"""
Expose commonly used route policies for external import.

The `base` module defines the `RoutePolicy` abstract base class.  The
`heuristics` module provides simple heuristics such as nearest-neighbor and
2-opt.  The `ortools_tsp` module provides a TSP-based optimization using
OR-Tools with a fallback to the nearest-neighbor heuristic if OR-Tools is
unavailable.  Importing these classes here makes them available as
`coldchain_sim.policies.NearestNeighborPolicy`, etc.
